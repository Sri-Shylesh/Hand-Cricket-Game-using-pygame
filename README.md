# Hand-Cricket-Game-using-pygame

This is a multiplayer hand cricket game I developed with the help of python, the module pygame and socket programming.
Multiple players can play at the same time, as the server is optimized to handle multiple requests.
I developed this application with the help of tutorials from Teech with Tim.
