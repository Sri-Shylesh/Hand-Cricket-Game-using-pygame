# Hand-Cricket-Game-using-pygame

This is a multiplayer hand cricket game I developed with the help of python, the module pygame and socket programming.
Multiple players can play at the same time, as the server is optimized to handle multiple requests.
These players could be from anywhere in the world if the server is hosted on a server.
When many players join the game at once, we separate the sessions into pairs where one player gets to play with another player.
I developed this application with the help of tutorials from Tech with Tim, where he developed a similar Tic Tac Toe Game.
